The verdict comes after a group of users brought the case claiming Google accessed users’ mobile devices to collect, save and use their data, in violation of privacy assurances in its Web & App Activity setting. Plaintiffs allege that regardless of whether Class Members had these settings paused or turned off, Google collected app activity data using certain code embedded within many non-Google apps. Technically, it doesn’t really make sense that flipping a switch on an Android phone would turn off Google Analytics across the Web and third-party apps. Google employees accordingly describe WAA as a “terrible control” (GOOG-RDGZ-00130416) and a “loser” (GOOG-RDGZ-00144760), and lament how “Web & App Activity is the worst name ever” (GOOG-RDGZ-00089546). In comparison, the Apple lawsuits are about how turning off a system-wide “share analytics” switch did not prevent system apps from sending personally identifiable data to Apple.
