      " - (similarity: 0.61) Microsoft Corp. MSFT has successfully evaded a substantial antitrust penalty as the European Union has agreed to the tech behemoth’s commitment to separate its Teams platform from its productivity applications. EU Clears Microsoft After Teams Separation PledgeThe EU, on Friday, announced that it has agreed to Microsoft’s commitments to separate its Teams workplace communication platform from its popular productivity apps. Microsoft will provide versions of its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 software suites at a discounted rate without including Teams. The EU launched its antitrust investigation into Microsoft in July 2023 after Salesforce-owned Slack, a competing chat service to Teams, filed a complaint. This recent move by Microsoft to unbundle Teams from its productivity apps is another step in its ongoing compliance with EU regulations.\n",

Its impressive 39% year-over-year increase in Azure cloud revenue last quarter was faster than competitors, indicating significant market share gains. This puts Microsoft in a great position to provide cloud services globally with high-speed performance and low latency. Moreover, the integration of cloud services through Microsfot Office software is also driving solid growth in its flagship software products. Strong AI adoption on the platform is helping Snowflake build a sticky ecosystem of services that could sustain strong growth.\n",

In fact, despite its low yield, Microsoft arguably remains one of the best dividend stocks around -- despite its conservative dividend yield. Here are three reasons Microsoft's dividend still stands out. Strong dividend growth potentialMicrosoft has been paying quarterly dividends for years and has repeatedly lifted the rate. These robust investments should secure strong double-digit annualized revenue and earnings growth for Microsoft for the next few years at least, providing nice support for continued dividend growth.\n",

The company has higher gross profit of $52.43 Billion , which indicates 35.19x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations.

Just like Nebius, CoreWeave also rents out its dedicated, GPU-powered data centers to customers looking to run AI and machine learning (ML) workloads. The company plans to end the year with 900 MW of active data center capacity.

Management highlighted a record for total revenue in the quarter ending in June, as well as an all-time high for services revenue. To this end, Apple's services gross margin was about 76% in the quarter, versus roughly 35% for products. And if hardware demand underwhelms for multiple cycles, the knock-on effects to services growth could slow. These dynamics -- rising services revenue and significantly higher services margins -- are the parts of the Apple story that matter most as investors look toward fiscal 2026.\n",
