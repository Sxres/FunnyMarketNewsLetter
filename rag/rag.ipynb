The business has a 50-day moving average price of $172.73 and a 200 day moving average price of $140.21.\" Another part says \"NVDA opened at $168.31 on Tuesday.\" So the latest price mentioned is $168.31 on Tuesday. But the user might be asking for the current price, but since the data is from the articles, I need to go with the latest date in the articles. The articles mention Monday and Tuesday, so the last one is Tuesday's open at $168.31. I should present that as the latest price. But wait, the user might be expecting real-time data, but the instructions say to rely only on the retrieved articles. So I need to make sure to include that the latest price mentioned is $168.31. Also, the articles mention insider sales and other activities, which I can weave into the rant. Let me structure the response as a chaotic WSB rant, including the price, the moving averages, and the insider sales, all while using the slang and profanity as per the rules. Make sure to mention the average ratings and price targets from the articles too, like the \"Moderate Buy\" and $207.69 target. Also, include the insider selling and the recent upgrades to \"strong-buy\" ratings. Keep it all in one paragraph, loud and degenerate.\n",

      "YOLO, YOLO, YOLO, the stock opened at $168.31 on Tuesday like some degenerate clown trying to flex on the 50-day moving average of $172.73 and the 200-day corpse of $140.21, but who gives a shit when the insiders are selling 3.8 million shares for $619 million like they’re all going to die and need to cash out before the apocalypse? Oh wait, the bagholders are crying about their $167.02 Monday open, but who cares when Selway Asset Management bought a lil’ chunk for $269k and KeyCorp just upped their target to $230? You know what’s real? The “strong-buy” ratings from Arete Research and Phillip Securities, and the fact that NVIDIA’s now 6.3% of Lockheed Martin’s portfolio, like some degenerate king of the chip game! But don’t get too happy, because JPMorgan’s “overweight” at $215 and KeyCorp’s $230 is just a bunch of Wall Street cuckolds trying to make money off your paper hands while the CEO and directors are literally selling their own shares like they’re about to get nuked by the Fed! And don’t even get me started on that $5.29 billion GAMMA Investing LLC position—some degenerate hedge fund with a 48 million share stake, and they’re all like “we’re buying because the future is GPUs and AI and crypto and memes and YOLO, baby!” But yeah, the stock’s down 2.7% today, and the only thing that matters is that the bagholders are still crying about their $167.02 open while the pros are flexing their $230 targets and “strong-buy” ratings like they’re some degenerate financial god! You know what’s real? The fact that NVIDIA’s 2.7% of Invesco’s portfolio and the CEO owns $12.28 billion worth of stock, and if you’re not in this, you’re just a mega cuck who missed the boat and now has to watch the degenerates send it to the moon while you’re stuck with your paper hands and your “Moderate Buy” rating from Wall Street’s retarded analysts! YOLO, send it, and if you’re not in it, you’re just a bagholder who’s gonna die with a $167.02 open and a $140.21 200-day moving average, and the only thing that matters is that the degenerates are making money while you’re crying about your stonks and your “regarded” ratings from some retarded analyst who’s probably still using a spreadsheet from 2015!"
