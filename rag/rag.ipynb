      "Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants news on NVIDIA. First, I need to go through all the provided articles and extract the key points. \n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the first article, there's mention of Selway Asset Management buying NVIDIA stock for $269k, and the average rating is \"Moderate Buy\" with a price target of $207.69. The stock is down 2.7% and has moving averages at $172.73 and $140.21. Also, NVIDIA's profile is mentioned, but it's a bit generic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, there's a Reuters report about Chinese tech firms like Alibaba and ByteDance still interested in NVIDIA's AI chips despite regulatory issues. They need reassurance about H20 model orders. Also, Trump's deal for 15% H20 revenue for the US government. NVIDIA's Q3 2026 revenue is expected at $54B, excluding H20 China shipments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, Wall Street Zen upgraded to \"buy,\" Arete Research to \"strong-buy,\" and some insider sales by Tench Coxe and Jen Hsun Huang. Hedge funds are active, and some cut or increased stakes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another article talks about NVIDIA's position in NS Partners Ltd's holdings, worth $165.89M, and Universal Beteiligungs buying a huge stake of $2.98B. MarketBeat's average rating and price target are reiterated.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a mention of insider selling causing a 3.9% drop, with shares sold at $172 and $170.63. Current financial ratios like current ratio 4.21, quick ratio 3.60, debt-to-equity 0.08. \n",
      "\n",
      "Nvidia denied chip shortage rumors, which caused a 3% drop. The stock is now the world's largest by market cap, with potential for more gains. \n",
      "\n",
      "Putting this all together, the user probably wants a mix of recent performance, analyst ratings, insider activity, and market sentiment. They might be looking for both positive and negative factors. Since the user is on WallStreetBets, they might be interested in hype, insider moves, and potential for growth. Need to highlight the upgrades, big hedge fund buys, and the regulatory stuff with China. Also, the stock price movements and the denial of shortages. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure to include all these points in a chaotic, degenerate way, using slang and memes. Avoid being too formal, add some profanity, and make it sound like a WSB rant. Maybe start with the big stakes, mention the analysts, then the insider sales, the China stuff, and the price targets. End with the stock's current status and the potential for more gains. Check that all the numbers are accurate from the articles and not made up. Also, make sure to mention the average rating and price target as per MarketBeat. Avoid any markdown and keep it all in one long paragraph.\n",

      "YOLO, motherfucker, NVIDIA is spitting fire and you’re not invited to the party unless you’re holding a bag of tendies and a 401(k) that’s screaming in the background like a broke bagholder! Selway Asset Management just snatched up a lil’ chunk of NVDA for $269k, but who’s counting? The stock’s currently at $167.02, which is like a midlife crisis for a tech giant—down 2.7% and still trying to look cool with its 50-day moving average at $172.73 and 200-day at $140.21. But here’s the real news, motherfucker: Alibaba, ByteDance, and other Chinese tech titans are still gnawing on NVIDIA’s H20 AI chips like it’s a buffet, even though Beijing’s regulators are giving them the finger. They need to chill, but the H20 is back in the game, and Trump’s already got 15% of that revenue locked in for the US government. And don’t even get me started on the Q3 2026 revenue forecast—$54 billion, baby! That’s not a typo, that’s a number so big it could fund a war on drugs and a new NBA team. Wall Street Zen just flipped from “hold” to “buy,” and Arete Research is screaming “strong-buy” like it’s the last day of the month and they’re running out of time to cash out. But wait, some insiders are selling—Tench Coxe just dumped a million shares, and the CEO’s offloading 75k, like, what’s the deal? Hedge funds are flipping like it’s a casino, some cutting stakes, others buying like they’re in a bear market for Bitcoin. Oh, and NS Partners Ltd? They’re holding 7.3% of NVDA, and Universal Beteiligungs just bought a $3 billion stake, which is like a nuclear bomb in the stock market. The stock’s current ratio is 4.21, quick ratio 3.60, and debt-to-equity is 0.08—NVIDIA’s got the liquidity of a billionaire’s vault. But here’s the kicker: the stock dropped 3.9% after an insider sold shares, and the market’s still trying to figure out if there’s a shortage of H100 and H200 chips, but NVIDIA’s denying it like it’s a conspiracy theory. And let’s not forget, this stock is now the world’s largest by market cap, and the boys in the lab are still screaming about AI and the moonshot. So, bagholders, if you’re still holding onto NVDA, you’re either a genius or a fool—because this shit’s about to go parabolic, and the only thing holding it back is your dumbass YOLO strategy. Send it, motherfucker, send it! 🚀🌕"
