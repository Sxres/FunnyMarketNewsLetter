Management highlighted a record for total revenue in the quarter ending in June, as well as an all-time high for services revenue. To this end, Apple's services gross margin was about 76% in the quarter, versus roughly 35% for products. And if hardware demand underwhelms for multiple cycles, the knock-on effects to services growth could slow. These dynamics -- rising services revenue and significantly higher services margins -- are the parts of the Apple story that matter most as investors look toward fiscal 2026.\n",
