AI darlings—and the buzz around Apple's iPhone 17 launch—kept the crowd cheering, promising faster growth just ahead. Still, traders expect a 25 bp cut on September 17, and are already whispering about more in October and December. Oracle Corporation ORCL reported first-quarter earnings of $1.47 per share and revenue of $14.92 billion, with both figures slightly under Street estimates. Microsoft Corporation MSFT is planning significant investments in proprietary artificial intelligence chip infrastructure to achieve “self-sufficiency in AI,” according to leaked comments from AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman during an internal town hall meeting. Alibaba Group Holding Limited BABA released its latest artificial intelligence model.
If you're looking for excellent stocks that can withstand the oscillations of the market over time, I recommend MercadoLibre (MELI 0.10%), Dutch Bros (BROS -2.66%), and Apple (AAPL 1.82%). MercadoLibre: E-commerce and fintechMercadoLibre is a no-brainer for investors looking for long-term growth. New active customers, the foundation of the consumer shift to e-commerce, increased 35% over last year. It has released a slew of Apple Intelligence services, but it doesn't seem to have found a breakout AI model like many of its most direct competitors. This is the kind of innovation that will make Apple Intelligence stand out.
The past week has been a whirlwind of tech news, with major players like Palantir Technologies, Intel Corp, and Apple Inc. making headlines. From concerns over government equity stakes to new health features on smartwatches, the tech industry continues to evolve and surprise. Palantir Co-Founder Unsettled By Government’s Intel StakeJoe Lonsdale, co-founder of Palantir Technologies, expressed discomfort over the federal government’s equity stake in Intel. FDA Approves Hypertension Alerts On Apple WatchApple’s latest smartwatch, the Apple Watch Ultra 3, has received FDA approval for a new hypertension notification feature. Investor Criticizes Apple’s AI StrategyPeter Andersen, founder and chief investment officer of Andersen Capital Management, criticized Apple’s weak artificial intelligence strategy.
Without as much potential for negative developments, both companies have a clear path to $4 trillion valuations. Many have seen the rise of AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Perplexity as threats to Alphabet's main Google Search business. That may gain some traction after Apple's entire September product presentation barely made mention of any new AI features. More AI features in the iPhone could unlock opportunities for premium services or opportunities for developers to use more AI features built on Apple's AI framework with privacy protections in mind. In the meantime, the threat of AI chatbots has failed to make a dent in Alphabet's revenue from Google Search.
Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have been on fire this year, but there are still bargains out there. Let's look at two AI stocks that still look cheap and could have plenty of upside ahead. Investors were worried that AI would eat into Google Search, but search revenue growth actually accelerated last quarter, and new AI features like AI Overviews and AI Mode are driving more queries, not fewer. Demand for AI chips, meanwhile, remains red-hot. Beyond AI, TSMC could also benefit from growth in areas like autonomous driving, robotics, and quantum computing.
Apple Inc. AAPL saw its entry-level iPhone 17 model dominate pre-orders on China’s JD.com platform, with the 256GB configuration receiving the most orders among all new iPhone models after pre-orders launched on Friday. Apple has postponed pre-orders for the iPhone Air in China due to regulatory issues with eSIM approval, according to a report by South China Morning Post. However, U.S. customers can still expect to receive their iPhone Air models by the launch day on September 19. Wall Street Raises Price Targets Post-LaunchEarlier, Wall Street analysts praised Apple’s iPhone 17. Bank of America Securities BAC analyst Wamsi Mohan upgraded Apple’s price target from $260 to $270, maintaining a Buy rating.
The Magnificent Seven still has value, but it is incomplete without the hottest artificial intelligence (AI) stock -- Oracle. On Sept. 9, Oracle delivered excellent results and guidance for 77% revenue growth from Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) in fiscal 2026, which was ahead of its prior target. Oracle penetrated the cloud infrastructure moatOracle's results and near-term guidance weren't even the best part of its earnings sprint. Oracle has set the tableOracle's blowout quarter and guidance showcase why it is the hottest AI growth stock to buy in 2026. It also pokes a hole in the seemingly impenetrable cloud infrastructure fortress dominated by the big three.
Apple's fall product event grabs attention, but the services engine is what investors should watch as fiscal 2026 approaches. Management highlighted a record for total revenue in the quarter ending in June, as well as an all-time high for services revenue. To this end, Apple's services gross margin was about 76% in the quarter, versus roughly 35% for products. And if hardware demand underwhelms for multiple cycles, the knock-on effects to services growth could slow. These dynamics -- rising services revenue and significantly higher services margins -- are the parts of the Apple story that matter most as investors look toward fiscal 2026.
Apple's $20 billion search deal lifeline could be the hidden catalyst Wall Street is overlooking -- here's why it matters for investors right now. Apple (AAPL 1.82%) just secured a massive advantage from the Department of Justice's ruling against Alphabet's Google, preserving $20 billion in annual revenue while strengthening its high-margin services growth. Investors may be underestimating Apple's leverage and long-term stability. Stock prices used were the market prices of Sept. 8, 2025. The video was published on Sept. 12, 2025.
Both businesses want to maintain the status quoBoth Apple and Alphabet have some of the most recognizable brands on the planet. Winner: TieAlphabet is putting up better growth figuresSince 2023, Apple's growth has been practically nonexistent. As a result, I think it's fairly clear that Alphabet has far better growth than Apple. As a result, Apple's stock has become far more expensive than it normally is, while Alphabet is just returning to its usual valuation range. This makes Alphabet a far better buy considering its growth.

Oracle ORCL surged ~36% in one session on booming AI-cloud orders, briefly making Larry Ellison the world's richest person as his net worth overtook Elon Musk. Tech names led gains: Tesla TSLA, Microsoft MSFT, and Micron MU pulled ahead, though Apple AAPL stumbled after its new product unveiling. Oracle's strong performance has become a flashpoint — raising questions about whether its gains are sustainable or tied to too-concentrated AI orders.

Apple (AAPL 1.82%) and Eli Lilly (LLY -0.20%) share several similarities. However, despite their poor performances this year, Apple and Eli Lilly still appear to be attractive stocks. In fact, they have qualities that make them likely to deliver excellent returns over the long run, making them great forever picks. Its forward yield is currently unimpressive at 0.8%, but its dividend has increased by 200% over the past 10 years. The stock's recent dip presents an excellent opportunity for investors to purchase shares and hold them for the long term.
Warren Buffett's investments in stocks like Apple and Coca-Cola have propelled Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating returns for six decades. However, Buffett has plowed a whopping $77.8 billion into another stock since 2018 -- more than twice as much as he invested in Apple -- but you won't find it in Berkshire's portfolio. He especially likes companies with shareholder-friendly initiatives like stock buyback programs and dividends, because they compound his returns much faster. Buffett has plowed $77.8 billion into Berkshire stock since 2018Berkshire now has a market capitalization of more than $1 trillion. Buffett has authorized a whopping $77.8 billion worth of buybacks since 2018, which is more than twice as much as he invested in Apple.
Investors might be wondering if it's time to look elsewhere when allocating capital, especially since this top AI stock has soared so much. Is Apple (AAPL 1.82%) as good a stock as Nvidia? Meanwhile, Nvidia is in a league of its own, with the stock skyrocketing 30,000%. Investing is a personal gameTo say that a stock is as good as another one depends on an individual investor's perspective. Both Apple and Nvidia are monster businesses worth trillions of dollars.

On Tuesday, Apple Inc. AAPL introduced Apple Watch Ultra 3. The company said Apple Watch Ultra 3 can be pre-ordered today, with availability beginning Friday, Sept. 19. Hypertension notifications on Apple Watch use data from the optical heart sensor to analyze how a user's blood vessels respond to the beats of the heart. While hypertension notifications will not detect all instances of hypertension, with the reach of Apple Watch, the feature is expected to notify over 1 million people with undiagnosed hypertension within the first year. Hypertension notifications will be available on Apple Watch Series 9 and later, and Apple Watch Ultra 2 and later, with watchOS 26, which begins rolling out on Sept. 15.

Apple P/E Compared to CompetitorsThe P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of 34.82 in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, Apple Inc. has a higher P/E ratio of 34.91. In summary, while the price-to-earnings ratio is a valuable tool for investors to evaluate a company's market performance, it should be used with caution. A low P/E ratio can be an indication of undervaluation, but it can also suggest weak growth prospects or financial instability. By taking a comprehensive approach to analyzing a company's financial health, investors can make well-informed decisions that are more likely to lead to successful outcomes.
In our analysis, there are two reasons for the latest buying in gold: Momo stock gurus have now discovered gold. After the jobless claims data was released, euphoria broke out amongst stock market investors, due to higher pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates.

Apple AAPL postponed the launch of its new iPhone Air in mainland China due to pending regulatory approval. When pre-orders opened on Friday, Apple's China website blocked customers from ordering the slimmer device and displayed a notice stating release details would follow once they win approval. Apple's website noted that China Mobile and China Telecom will eventually offer compatibility. Apple stock lost over 8% year-to-date, trailing the NASDAQ Composite Index’s over 14% returns. Analysts praised Apple's iPhone 17 launch for slimmer designs, upgraded cameras, and stronger AI-health features, but warned of limits to growth.
Microsoft Corp. MSFT has successfully evaded a substantial antitrust penalty as the European Union has agreed to the tech behemoth’s commitment to separate its Teams platform from its productivity applications. EU Clears Microsoft After Teams Separation PledgeThe EU, on Friday, announced that it has agreed to Microsoft’s commitments to separate its Teams workplace communication platform from its popular productivity apps. Microsoft will provide versions of its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 software suites at a discounted rate without including Teams. The EU launched its antitrust investigation into Microsoft in July 2023 after Salesforce-owned Slack, a competing chat service to Teams, filed a complaint. This recent move by Microsoft to unbundle Teams from its productivity apps is another step in its ongoing compliance with EU regulations.
So, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly? So, $6,000 / $1.04 = 5,769 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $1.04 = 1,154 shares ($100 per month). Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time. How that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock’s current price. For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50).
This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

A look back at the stock market's dominant companies in 1995 shows just how much has changed in the past three decades. The stock market's biggest companies looked very different 30 years ago. On Dec. 29, 1995, the top three names were ExxonMobil with a market cap of $101 billion, Coca-Cola at $93 billion, and General Electric at $74 billion. While each one existed in 1995, none were in the top 20 at that time, and Nvidia hadn't even gone public yet. The former largest company in the world has lagged the S&P 500 over the last three years.

Much of the tech and business world over the past couple of years has revolved around artificial intelligence (AI) and any company remotely dealing with the technology. It has made many AI stocks some of the best-performing stocks during that time, but it has also brought many AI companies into the light that are only there because of pure speculation and hype. What makes Alphabet a great AI stock is that it has its hands in virtually all major phases of the technology:Its AI research company, DeepMind, is responsible for critical breakthroughs that have pushed the entire AI field forward. Its cloud platform, Google Cloud, allows it to train, deploy, and scale its AI models in-house (and its quantum computing advancements could make this faster and more efficient). The icing on the cake is that Alphabet seems to be undervalued compared to its other "Magnificent Seven" peers.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) rose by over 3% in August. As in any month with any index, however, there were some laggards among the 30 DJIA component stocks. This would value the company at around $500 billion, a staggering amount for a business that's still privately held. The company showed impressive revenue growth, as per its habit of late, but topped the consensus analyst estimates only slightly. With such lofty valuations and still-big hopes pinned to the future of AI, investors were clearly expecting far better.

All AI chip roads lead to this red-hot stockJustin Pope (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing): The AI landscape will undoubtedly evolve, but it's hard to imagine that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, or TSMC, won't remain one of the biggest AI winners. Nvidia and most other chip companies design the chips used in AI data centers and throughout almost every technological application you can think of. This is critical, as free cash flow also does not include the $75 billion Alphabet pledged to invest in capital expenditures (capex) in 2025.

Investing in dividend stocks doesn't have to mean leaving the trends that young investors identify with. However, young people should not write off dividend stocks as a potent wealth-building tool. Here are five dividend stocks that are perfect for Gen Z investors to buy and hold for the long term. Given Broadcom's wide-open AI opportunities and a modest 36% dividend payout ratio, Gen Z investors should enjoy many years of healthy dividend increases ahead. Gen Z investors might also appreciate that CEO Mark Zuckerberg is still in his early 40s, meaning he likely has decades until retirement.
Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has voiced his concerns over potential security risks associated with OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which could lead to the leakage of personal user data. A significant threat to personal user data was identified by software engineer Eito Miyamura in the wake of a recent update to ChatGPT. The team demonstrated this threat through an experiment that showed how private user data could be extracted from these platforms. Buterin’s response to the security warning highlights the ongoing debate around AI governance and the potential risks associated with AI integration into personal data platforms. His proposed “info finance” approach suggests a shift towards a more open and participatory model of AI security, which could potentially mitigate such risks.

Beyond the spectacular news for Oracle investors, the results provide insight into the broader AI landscape, and there are specific implications for Palantir. As I wrote at the time, "Palantir will move Foundry workloads to Oracle Cloud. As such, Palantir is well positioned to benefit as Oracle expands its AI and cloud infrastructure services. Given Palantir's strong ties to Oracle Cloud, this provides a growing pool of potential customers for Palantir to tap along the way.

The Company intends to complete the Shares-for-Debt Settlement to preserve cash to finance future operations. Completion of the Shares-for-Debt Settlement is subject to receipt of all necessary TSX Venture Exchange (the “Exchange”) approvals. All securities issued pursuant to the Shares-for-Debt Settlement will also be subject to resale restrictions in Canada for a period of 4 months and a day from their date of issuance. There can be no assurance that forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate as actual results, and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements.
The tech conglomerate is now required to share its valuable Google search data with the competition. How the court's decision affects Alphabet's AI ambitionsThe Sept. 2 legal ruling bars Alphabet from signing exclusive contracts with partners such as Apple. Is Alphabet's AI position at risk? AI contributed to growth in Alphabet's cloud computing segment, Google Cloud, as well. Compared to the Google search case, this separate antitrust lawsuit poses a lower risk.
OpenAI on Friday introduced a new program, dubbed the "OpenAI Grove," for early tech entrepreneurs looking to build with artificial intelligence, and applications are already open. Following the program, Grove participants will be able to continue working internally with the ChatGPT maker, which was recent valued $500 billion. Other industry rivals have also already launched their own AI accelerator programs, including the Google for Startups Cloud AI Accelerator last winter. Earlier this April, Microsoft for Startups partnered with PearlX, a cohort accelerator program for pre-seed companies. AI startups raised $104.3 billion in the U.S. in the first half of this year, and currently over 1,300 AI startups have valuations of over $100 million, according to CB Insights.
Nvidia is the king of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, and for good reason. Two stocks to take a closer look at are Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.91%) and Broadcom (AVGO 0.19%). Both are smaller players in AI chips, and as the market shifts from training toward inference, they're both well positioned. Instead of designing off-the-shelf GPUs, Broadcom is helping customers make their own customer AI chips. Broadcom is a leader in helping design application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, and it has taken that expertise and applied it to making custom AI chips.

The company needs to prove its business worthy before I'll consider owning Rezolve stock.
The tech giant has given Nebius such a lucrative deal to gain access to the latter's New Jersey data center. This is a dedicated AI data center powered by graphics processing units (GPUs), and Microsoft is going to use the same for handling AI workloads. Just like Nebius, CoreWeave also rents out its dedicated, GPU-powered data centers to customers looking to run AI and machine learning (ML) workloads. The company plans to end the year with 900 MW of active data center capacity. What's more, its contracted data center capacity of 2.2 gigawatts (GW) indicates that it can substantially ramp up its capacity in the long run.
Whether you love it or hate it, it's increasingly looking like artificial intelligence (AI) is a major technological shift that will have huge implications for our economy over the long term.

Elon Musk's electric vehicle company is proposing to make a strategic investment in his artificial intelligence company. Ever since artificial intelligence (AI) emerged as the market's defining megatrend, growth investors have poured money into megacap technology stocks. This same logic extends to Optimus, Tesla's planned humanoid robot. Is a Tesla investment in xAI a game changer? The question of whether an equity stake in xAI could truly be a game changer for Tesla is more nuanced than it first appears.
The Invesco QQQ Trust is full of high-powered growth stocks that can make it an ideal investment for the long haul. Invest regularly in a high-powered growth fundIf you're investing each week, it's important to keep the process simple. One exchange-traded fund (ETF) that can be ideal for this purpose is the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ 0.44%). While it may not be a smooth ride, investing in the ETF regularly can set you up for some significant gains. The S&P 500 has averaged a long-run annual return of 10%, and the Invesco ETF has outperformed it in recent years.
Elon Musk has challenged Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella over comments allegedly made by employees of Microsoft’s gaming division, Activision Blizzard, celebrating the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk. The contentious posts were supposedly made by developers and employees of Activision Blizzard on social media platform X.Musk, in response to the post, tagged Nadella, seeking an explanation for the incident. Charlie Kirk, a fervent supporter of President Donald Trump, was assassinated on Wednesday at the Utah Valley University campus. This incident has sparked controversy and raised questions about the responsibility of tech companies in moderating content on their platforms. The alleged comments by Activision Blizzard employees, if true, could potentially harm Microsoft’s reputation and customer trust.
Cybersecurity threats are a persistent problem for companies across the globe, requiring businesses, small and large, to devote some of their budgets to fighting them. IDC estimates that cybersecurity spending is on the rise and will reach an estimated $377 billion by 2028. Palo Alto is a cybersecurity leader that's continually growingPalo Alto Networks shocked investors recently when it announced that it was acquiring CyberArk, an identity access management leader, for $25 billion -- the largest purchase by Palo Alto by far. With Microsoft already a leading AI and cloud computing company, in addition to having an impressive cybersecurity business, the company is one of the best no-brainer tech stocks to own. And with the stock sliding about 3% over the past month, now is a good time to buy shares as the company continues to lead in the expanding AI and cybersecurity markets.
And while this is undoubtedly sound investing advice, the current state of the S&P 500 means this advice may be much trickier to follow. Investors can't change how the S&P 500 is weighted, but what they can do is understand this overconcentration and the risks that come along with it. Another option, if you're still interested in investing in the S&P 500, would be to invest in an equal-weight S&P 500 ETF like the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP -0.72%). Instead of weighing the companies by market cap, this ETF splits investments roughly equally among all S&P 500 companies. The composition of the standard S&P 500 will inevitably change as companies' market caps change, but the current overconcentration risk is something investors should keep in mind when following Buffett's "just invest in the S&P 500" advice.
The original purpose of Nvidia GPUs was to accelerate graphics rendering in video games. With CUDA programming, developers can use Nvidia's GPUs to code and make applications. Becoming the leading AI companyCrypto miners drove demand for Nvidia GPUs, but what unlocked even more growth for the company was AI technology. A year later, Alex Krizhevsky used Nvidia GPUs and CUDA to train a neural network, AlexNet. The massive success of ChatGPT upon its release in 2022 was another sign of how powerful Nvidia GPUs are.
Nvidia has a multibillion-dollar stock portfolio that invests in artificial intelligence stocks. One company that Nvidia invests in is the AI infrastructure company Nebius Group (NBIS 1.24%). Recently, Nebius struck a blockbuster deal, sending shares soaring, and investors can't seem to get enough of the stock. Its data centers are specifically modeled for running AI applications and also equipped with Nvidia's latest graphics processing units (GPUs). There appears to be plenty of runway for Nebius stock.
When I visited the Silicon Valley headquarters of Oracle (ORCL -5.05%) 25 years ago as a young technology reporter, I was dumbstruck. It's the backlog of business that stunned the market and sent the share price soaring. Oracle said it expects revenue from its cloud infrastructure unit to surge 77% this year, to $18 billion. Multibillion-dollar customers"Clearly, it was an excellent quarter and demand for Oracle Cloud infrastructure continues to build," CEO Safra Katz said on the Sept. 9 earnings call. But Oracle is certainly a golden stock for its shareholders.
Without Broadcom and Oracle, the "Magnificent Seven" is no longer a good representation of the market's leading growth stocks. The "Ten Titans" provide an update to the Magnificent Seven by adding Broadcom, Oracle, and Netflix to the list. Here's why Broadcom and Oracle have become such dominant companies, and whether either growth stock is a buy now. Like Broadcom, Oracle was once an entrenched business-to-business giant in tech, known for its stodgy growth and reliable dividend. Nvidia has become a pure-play AI stock because its data center business is now magnitudes larger than its gaming and professional visualization markets.
These AI growth stocks may still be undervalued on Wall Street. There are 10 companies with a market cap over $1 trillion right now, and all of these except one are involved in artificial intelligence (AI). It reported accelerating revenue growth over the last year. Palantir stock is expensive, trading at high multiples of sales and earnings. AMD's chips are clearly addressing needs in the AI market.

Investing in tech stocks is the best way to beat the market right now. There's no better sector for investors in 2025 than tech stocks. Investors are flocking to tech stocks, pushing their valuations higher by the quarter. If you want to beat the market and grow your portfolio, tech stocks are some of the best names you can choose. As part of your well-rounded portfolio, one way you can achieve your financial goals is by picking some tech stocks that you can comfortably own for a decade.
Popular artificial intelligence (AI) stocks Palantir and Arm may be headed for colossal losses. Those gains have left both stocks trading at rich valuations, so much so that certain Wall Street analysts recommend selling. That implies 73% downside from its current share price of $171. That implies 46% downside from its current share price of $150. That means Palantir would still be the most expensive stock in the index even if it lost 75% of its value.
Philippe Laffont, one of Wall Street's most successful hedge fund managers, expects Microsoft and Nvidia to be the most valuable companies in the world by 2030. Coatue expects them to be the largest companies in the world by 2030, with market values approaching $6 trillion, as detailed below:Coatue estimates Microsoft will be worth $5.7 trillion in 2030. Coatue estimates Nvidia will be worth $5.6 trillion in 2030. Microsoft and Nvidia are two of the largest positions in his $36 billion portfolio, accounting for over 10% of his invested assets. In cloud computing, Microsoft recently introduced Azure AI Foundry, a suite of pretrained models and tools that let customers develop, customize, and manage AI applications.
Microsoft Corp. MSFT co-founder Bill Gates and Breakthrough Energy are backing Fervo Energy‘s Cape Station project in Beaver County, Utah. The facility will become the world’s largest enhanced geothermal power plant, generating 100 MW by 2026 and expanding to 500 MW by 2028. In his September 4 Gates Notes post “Turn up the heat,” Gates detailed his visit to Cape Station alongside Senator John Curtis, highlighting Utah’s leadership in energy innovation. This method lowers costs and makes geothermal energy possible in areas beyond typical tectonic plate regions. The Cape Station project is a significant expansion, with 20 out of 24 planned wells already drilled.
During an interview with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Tucker Carlson suggested Altman may have played a role in the death of former employee Suchir Balaji. During an interview with Altman, Carlson suggested that Balaji was murdered, a claim that Altman vehemently denied, maintaining that Balaji’s death was a suicide. Despite Altman’s denial, Carlson continued to insinuate that Altman may have been involved in Balaji’s death, even suggesting that Balaji’s mother believes Altman orchestrated her son’s murder. Earlier this year, Musk filed a lawsuit against Altman and OpenAI, alleging that they had violated the company's founding principles by partnering with Microsoft.

Of course, the case for Microsoft's dividend isn't about a high yield. In fact, despite its low yield, Microsoft arguably remains one of the best dividend stocks around -- despite its conservative dividend yield. Here are three reasons Microsoft's dividend still stands out. Strong dividend growth potentialMicrosoft has been paying quarterly dividends for years and has repeatedly lifted the rate. These robust investments should secure strong double-digit annualized revenue and earnings growth for Microsoft for the next few years at least, providing nice support for continued dividend growth.
Quantum computing utilizes quantum mechanics to solve complex problems more quickly than classical computers. IBM makes more quantum progress, but investors are unimpressedUp until recently, news related to IBM's quantum computing catalyst would elicit a positive reaction from the market. Now, however, further news regarding IBM's quantum catalyst hasn't seemed to excite investors all that much. On Aug. 26, IBM and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.91%) announced that they would collaborate on quantum computing, with AMD providing the chips needed to power IBM's quantum supercomputer. The software sales miss was relatively minor, $7.39 billion compared to $7.41 billion expected, and was mainly due to flat transaction processing software sales.
Were there specific warning signs in 1999 and 2007 that a savvy investor could have seen before the crashes of 2000 and 2008? Margin debt hits $1 trillion for the first time everOne potential warning sign is the money traders borrow to invest in stocks, known as margin debt. This metric recently hit an all-time high, topping $1 trillion for the first time in June and rising again in July. Why margin debt mattersInvestors should care about margin debt for two reasons. Here's what history says happens nextThis rapid rise in margin was exactly the kind of warning sign investors could have looked for in both 1999 and 2007.
Bill Gates once handed over a signed $1 bill to concede an argument, a rare souvenir that former Microsoft India chairman Ravi Venkatesan recently revealed he has framed. According to Ventakesan’s recall of events, the exchange occurred during a Gates visit to India around 2006–2007. His inner monologue turned outward, "So what if he's Bill Gates?" Melinda Gates, who was party to the argument, prodded the moment with a prompt, "Bill, what do you do?" — and Gates wrote on a $1 note, "I was wrong, Bill Gates."
While robotaxis dominate the conversation around Tesla's AI roadmap, there is another opportunity quietly flying under the radar that could carry even greater implications: Optimus, the company's humanoid robotics project. Industry leaders such as Nvidia's Jensen Huang have pointed to the multitrillion-dollar potential at the intersection of AI and robotics. This limitation highlights why humanoid robotics is such an ambitious frontier. Unlike traditional industrial robots, humanoid robots are built with arms, legs, and advanced dexterity, enabling them to perform human-level tasks in real-world environments. In many ways, humanoid robotics represent the closest manifestation of achieving generalized intelligence -- AI that doesn't just respond but actively engages with the physical world.
You get a great stock trading at bargain-basement valuations. Sometimes, it's a stock trading at low valuation ratios. And the orders are often related to AI services. Kyndryl's stock is less affordable from a couple of specific perspectives, trading at 31.5 times free cash flow and 6.1 times its book value. It deserves some of your attention, even if you're not quite ready to put real money in its stock yet.
Picking a stake in this high-quality artificial intelligence (AI) networking stock can supercharge your portfolio. AI data center catalystArista has established itself as a pure-play Ethernet networking company, delivering hardware and software networking solutions for large-scale AI data centers, as well as for campus and routing networks. While individually smaller than the big four hyperscaler clients, they are helping offset the slowness in ramp-up of the fourth hyperscaler customer and the loss of the fifth sovereign AI customer. Other marketsBesides AI networking, Arista is also strengthening its position in enterprise campus and wide-area network (WAN) segments. Hence, Arista can emerge as a major winner in the AI networking boom in the coming years.
The "Magnificent Seven" stocks have done incredibly well over the past five years, with six of them more than doubling in value during that time frame. Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla are the leading tech companies in the world, often referred to as the "Magnificent Seven." An ETF that can be helpful for this purpose is the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth Index Fund ETF (MGK 0.55%). Meanwhile, the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF is up by more than 13%, and it has even outperformed three of the Magnificent Seven stocks -- Amazon (8%), Apple (-5%), and Tesla (-14%). Is the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth Index Fund a good option for your portfolio?
From data centers to automotive to personal computers (PCs) to smartphones, TSMC benefits from rapid AI adoption on multiple fronts. But how much upside can investors expect from this semiconductor stock over the next year? That should set TSMC stock up for a strong finish to 2025. TSMC's 12-month median stock price target of $278 (as per 45 analysts covering the stock) points toward a potential jump of 11% from current levels. With TSMC trading at just 22 times forward earnings right now, investors would do well to buy this AI stock hand over fist as it has the potential to rise impressively in the coming year.
AI data center demand still looks white-hot. Shares of Applied Digital (APLD 8.73%) flew higher this week, finishing up 34.5%. The bullish news helped lift shares of companies across the market involved in AI data center building, including Applied Digital. There is a serious risk here that demand will cool and companies like Applied Digital will get left holding the bag. The risks are too great here, and I would stay away from Applied Digital stock -- as well as CoreWeave stock, for that matter.
The following companies are leaders in cloud services and data management that could deliver excellent returns. Its impressive 39% year-over-year increase in Azure cloud revenue last quarter was faster than competitors, indicating significant market share gains. This puts Microsoft in a great position to provide cloud services globally with high-speed performance and low latency. Moreover, the integration of cloud services through Microsfot Office software is also driving solid growth in its flagship software products. Strong AI adoption on the platform is helping Snowflake build a sticky ecosystem of services that could sustain strong growth.
Another AI-related hopeful, nuclear power start-up Oklo (OKLO 3.31%), has seen its shares rise by an astonishing 1,200% over the last year. But I think that, like Nvidia, its stock could be poised for even more record-breaking gains. Nuke that dataSay you want to build an energy-hungry facility like an AI data center. Some AI-focused companies like Microsoft and Meta Platforms have been contracting with solar power developers to secure renewable energy to power their data centers. Even if Oklo is able to produce a working prototype SMR by 2026, it will still be a long way away from dominance in the data center power supply business.
The market's excitement about the stock appeared to stem from the company's growing cloud computing business. Cloud excitementSometimes there is a last-mover's advantage, and in the cloud computing space, Oracle appears to have one. Before the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, the company's cloud computing unit was new and pretty small. Below is a table of Oracle's cloud infrastructure revenue projections. Within the cloud segment, cloud infrastructure revenue soared by 55% to $3.3 billion while cloud application revenue rose 11% to $3.8 billion.
In this article, we will undertake a comprehensive industry comparison, evaluating Microsoft MSFT and its primary competitors in the Software industry. The Return on Equity (ROE) of 8.19% is 1.39% above the industry average, highlighting efficient use of equity to generate profits. The company has higher gross profit of $52.43 Billion , which indicates 35.19x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations. When evaluating Microsoft alongside its top 4 peers in terms of the Debt-to-Equity ratio, the following insights arise:When comparing the debt-to-equity ratio, Microsoft is in a stronger financial position compared to its top 4 peers. Key TakeawaysFor Microsoft in the Software industry, the PE, PB, and PS ratios are all low compared to peers, indicating potential undervaluation.
With that timeframe not all that far away, investors are starting to take quantum computing stocks more seriously. Two of my favorite pure-play quantum computing companies are IonQ (IONQ 18.36%) and D-Wave Quantum (QBTS 7.66%). This hybrid computing approach is likely to become the primary use case of quantum computing. However, if it can be the first cloud computing provider to offer a viable quantum computing system, it stands to make a ton of money from various quantum computing workloads that will appear over the next decade. It allows investors to balance the risk of pure-play quantum computing investments that may not survive with established big tech players that are benefiting from current market trends and also have quantum computing investments.
But for every stock that delivers those multibagger returns, dozens of other promising stocks fizzle out. While it's impossible to consistently predict which stocks will generate millionaire-making gains, we can look back at how some top tech stocks minted new millionaires before. From fiscal 1999 to fiscal 2025 (which ended this January), its annual revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 29%. Its sales of AI chips will continue to rise, its weaker non-AI chip and infrastructure software segments should warm up again, and it will likely pursue more acquisitions. MicronMicron, one of the world's top manufacturers of DRAM and NAND memory chips, went public in 1984.
Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on past performance. Likewise, TipRanks' AI Analyst has an "outperform" rating on AVGO stock with a price target of $396. He added that Broadcom is on track to deliver about $20 billion in AI revenue in fiscal 2025. "Despite macro volatility, Broadcom's diversified portfolio and product cycles support a solid revenue growth profile," concluded Sur. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a "neutral" stock on ZS stock with a price target of $298.
The short answer is that Nvidia's dividend exists, but it is intentionally modest. The dividend is small -- and that's deliberateNvidia's current quarterly dividend is just $0.01 per share, or $0.04 annually. Given where the stock is trading at the time of this writing, Nvidia's dividend yield is about 0.02%, which is obviously negligible. Of course, such a small dividend means that the company is hardly tapping into its earnings power. Buybacks do the heavy liftingBut don't let Nvidia's small dividend fool you.
However, Wall Street seems to be turning increasingly bearish on the stock. According to Tipranks, just five out of the 20 analysts rating the stock call it a buy. While more analysts rate the stock a buy than a sell, sell ratings tend to be rare on Wall Street, and hold ratings are typically understood as cautious or sometimes a euphemism for sell. Valuation, valuation, valuationWhile Palantir's business results have clearly been impressive, the main reason the stock has soared is multiple expansion, rather than underlying business growth. Looking ahead, Palantir stock could continue to move higher, but some cautiousness is warranted given its sky-high valuation.
Let's look at three high-risk, high-potential-reward growth stocks that could be worth taking a swing at because they have home run potential that could help set you up for life. IonQIonQ (IONQ 18.36%) is trying to take quantum computing from something theoretical and turn it into something real that organizations can use, and it's making progress faster than many thought possible. While the basis for classical computing is bits representing 1s or 0s, for quantum computing, it is quantum bits, or qubits, that can represent 1s, 0s, or both simultaneously. SoundHound is still an early-stage company, but it is taking a unique approach to AI agents with its voice-first technology. Short sellers have gone after the stock, but AppLovin keeps delivering quarter after quarter, and so has the stock.
Cyberport may add some graphics processing units (GPUs) made in China to its Artificial Intelligence Supercomputing Centre in Hong Kong, as the government-run incubator seeks to reduce its reliance on Nvidia chips amid worsening China-US relations, its chief executive said. The park has been weighing the use of Chinese GPUs since it first began installing Nvidia chips last year, he said. “At that time, China-US relations were already quite strained, so relying solely on [Nvidia] was no longer an option,” Cheng said. Cyberport CEO Rocky Cheng Chung-ngam on September 12, 2025. Photo: Jonathan WongAs all four Chinese solutions offer similar performance, Cyberport would take cost into account when determining which ones to order, according to Cheng, declining to name the suppliers.
A state visit always sends a buzz through the newsroom — and U.S. President Donald Trump's trip to the U.K. next week looks set to deliver royal, political and business headlines, despite being his second such visit. U.S. President Donald Trump inspected an honour guard during a welcome ceremony at Buckingham Palace in central London on June 3, 2019, on the first day of their three-day State Visit to the U.K.Wednesday will bring the royal pomp and ceremony. Trump and First Lady Melania will be greeted at Windsor Castle by King Charles and Queen Camilla with a royal salute, followed by a carriage procession. The day will end with a state banquet, during which both the king and president will make speeches. Interestingly, just two weeks ago, the Telegraph reported that Trump had invited Mandelson's predecessor, Karen Pierce, to this week's state banquet, in a sign that trouble may already have been brewing.
The United Kingdom and the United States are set to sign a major technology agreement during President Trump‘s visit to the UK. This new partnership will emphasize collaboration on areas such as artificial intelligence, semiconductors, telecommunications, and quantum computing, aiming to strengthen ties between the two countries’ massive tech industries, according to a Reuters report. See Also: US Farmers Head To China As Trade Strains Weigh: ReportMajor Tech Executives Join DelegationPresident Trump will be joined by Nvidia Corp. NVDA CEO Jensen Huang and OpenAI‘s Sam Altman on his upcoming UK visit, highlighting the key role of major tech leaders in the growing U.S.-UK tech collaboration. AI Action Plans Drive CooperationBoth countries have published AI Action Plans this year. This agreement seeks to strengthen collaboration between the two countries’ tech industries, creating more opportunities for businesses and consumers.
AdvertisementAlibaba Cloud, the AI and cloud computing division of Alibaba, unveiled on Friday a new generation of large language models that it said heralded “the future of efficient LLMs”. The new models are nearly 13 times smaller than the company’s largest AI model, released just a week earlier. Emad Mostaque, co-founder of the UK-based start-up Stability AI, said on X that Alibaba’s new model outperformed “pretty much any model from last year” despite an estimated training cost of less than US$500,000. For comparison, training Google’s Gemini Ultra, released in February 2024, cost an estimated US$191 million, according to Stanford University’s AI Index. Alibaba says its new generation of AI foundation models heralds the “the future of efficient LLMs”.
When it comes to growth investing, finding businesses that can grow by leaps and bounds for decades to come is a dream. But that's what many popular artificial intelligence (AI) stocks today offer. Nvidia is my top choice for every growth investorIn my opinion, every growth investor should be paying close attention to Nvidia (NVDA 0.43%). This dominant market share is fueled by early investment and a powerful software platform that keeps users embedded within Nvidia's ecosystem. If you're new to growth investing, Nvidia needs to be one of the first companies you consider for your portfolio.
He started a hedge fund dubbed Situational Awareness last year, and it's quickly grown to more than $2 billion in assets under management. The fund revealed a massive hedge against the entire semiconductor industry in its most recent 13F filing with the SEC. At the same time, Aschenbrenner maintained his biggest position in one chipmaker while adding to his position in another important AI semiconductor stock. It's not necessarily a full blown bearish trade on every other semiconductor stock in the industry. There may be other AI stock opportunities with more attractive valuations at this point, but there are few alternatives based on the investment theses Aschenbrenner laid out.
Yet Navitas' stock now trades at about $6. Let's review what Navitas does, why the Nvidia deal lit a fire under its stock, and if it's worth buying. For 2025, analysts expect Navitas' revenue to decline 42% to $48.6 million as its net loss widens to $116.4 million. Therefore, Navitas' stock could be cut in half and still be expensive relative to its peers. If you don't already own Navitas' stock, you should probably wait for some clearer updates regarding its future roadmap before buying.
Given Musk's hype campaign, the launch felt narrower in scope than I had expected, leaving me questioning the true maturity of Tesla's autonomous driving systems. In the long run, Tesla's execution could put serious pressure on Uber (UBER 1.27%) and Lyft (LYFT 1.64%). But this is where the unit economics of Tesla's autonomous driving system prove transformative. I am far more optimistic about Tesla's robotaxi prospects than I was just a few months ago. While Tesla has opened the chess match with a strong move, it's premature to call this a "checkmate" situation against Uber and Lyft, though.
Oracle is a big Nvidia customer...Nvidia (NVDA 0.43%), the world's leading artificial intelligence (AI) chip designer, has spoken extensively about the AI opportunity ahead. And Nvidia's GPUs are the most powerful ones out there. In fact, last year, Oracle Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison said he "begged" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang for more GPUs. Nvidia, as mentioned, is the AI chip giant. Customers have demonstrated that they want to get in on the very latest Nvidia has to offer.
Supermicro stock is surging on the back of the AI boom -- but can the company's margins and accounting keep up with its explosive growth? Super Micro Computer (SMCI 2.50%) is fueling the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution with cutting-edge servers and racks designed for Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) Blackwell graphics processing units (GPUs). Can Supermicro overcome these hurdles and continue its explosive growth? *Stock prices used were the market prices of Sept. 12, 2025. The video was published on Sept. 13, 2025.
Fortunately, value-oriented investors can still find reasonably priced stocks in today's market. With that in mind, investors may want to consider these three growth stocks before they join the market's high flyers. Gaming was AMD's fastest-growing segment in the second quarter of 2025, and the decline in embedded revenue is now down to 3%. Overall, revenue growth in Q2 was 32%, helping to foster the aforementioned lower forward earnings multiple. As Uber stock's mobility and delivery revenues continue trending higher, it is likely to become pricier, creating an incentive for investors to buy the stock sooner rather than later.
If one had invested $10,000 on the day of the merger with the SPAC, they would have around $4,650 today. Navitas suffered the misfortune of beginning trading near the height of the 2021 bull market. Also, the $9.5 million to $10.5 million in revenue Navitas forecasted for Q3 would mean a further decline sequentially. Amid such numbers, prospects for Navitas' stock are still uncertain. Shareholders who invested $10,000 in October 2021 may experience a full recovery or even positive returns with the help of Nvidia.
Some of the most brilliant minds in the world work for these firms, so when they are still purchasing shares of a company that has risen as much as Nvidia, investors should pay attention. Even though many of Nvidia's largest clients have spent billions on building data centers filled with thousands of GPUs, Nvidia expects this total to continue rising rapidly. If this market pans out like Nvidia expects, it's a no-brainer buy at this price point, as the upside for its stock is immense. Nvidia stock will be a must-own if projections pan outFor FY 2026 (ending January 2026), Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia to generate $206 billion in revenue. Billionaires are still buying and holding Nvidia stock, giving individual investors a cue that Nvidia's run is far from over.
According to one key number in the report, the company is going to need significantly more data centers, which could be fantastic news for chipmakers. Oracle's order backlog just skyrocketedDevelopers can tap into remarkable amounts of processing power through Oracle's cloud data centers. Oracle's data centers use a proprietary random direct memory access (RDMA) networking technology that moves data between chips and devices faster than traditional Ethernet networks. What it means for Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and MicronDemand for Oracle's data center capacity has outstripped supply for the last couple of years, but never by this magnitude. Oracle will have to build new cloud infrastructure at a rapid pace to convert its enormous RPO into revenue.
McKinsey estimates that data centers will require nearly $7 trillion of investment by 2030 to meet demand for more computing power. Here are two AI growth stocks that are surging right now and could soar over the next few years. SoundHound's voice AI solutions are making it easier for people to interact with devices with normal conversational speech. The company is moving quickly to capture what it previously estimated was a $140 billion addressable market for voice AI technology. Soundhound isn't turning a profit yet as it continues to invest all its revenue into advancing its voice AI technology.
After a historic surge, Oracle's growth story may still be in the early innings. Shares ripped higher on Wednesday after the database pioneer and cloud infrastructure provider revealed a bookings spike that reframes the growth outlook. The question for investors is simple: After a move like this, is it too late to buy into this compelling growth story? "It was an astonishing quarter -- and demand for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure continues to build," CEO Safra Catz said. Catz previewed a sharp increase in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure revenue -- up 77% this fiscal year to $18 billion -- followed by a ramp to $32 billion, $73 billion, $114 billion, and $144 billion over the subsequent four years.
Meanwhile, Palantir shares have skyrocketed approximately 2,500% since the curtain opened on Jan. 1, 2023. The uniqueness of Palantir's AI- and ML-powered platforms is that there aren't substitutes, at least at scale. Tax-based selling, or selling stock after an options contract was exercised, aren't usually worrisome. But there's another side to this coin that adds validity to Nvidia's and Palantir's $12.5 billion warning to Wall Street. The last time an Nvidia insider purchased shares of stock on the open market was in early December 2020.
Stellantis' Ram 1500 Revolution battery-electric concept pickup truck is introduced during a keynote address by Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavaras during CES 2023 at the Venetian Resort Las Vegas on Jan. 5, 2023. Stellantis ' Ram brand is canceling plans to develop a full-size electric Ram 1500 pickup truck, citing slowing demand for electric vehicles. Ram said Friday it would still plan to launch an extended-range electric truck, which is equipped with an electric generator and a gas engine. The company said it would rename that extended-range truck from "Ramcharger" to the "Ram 1500 REV." The change comes as Ram CEO Tim Kuniskis, who unretired from the automaker late last year, has launched an aggressive turnaround for the embattled brand.

Nvidia (NVDA 0.43%) stock just hit new all-time highs. But there's a catch: Nvidia's latest rise has nothing to do with the company itself, at least not directly. Instead, there's another AI stock that is causing the entire industry to rise in valuation. News from Oracle is fueling Nvidia's stock priceAmazingly, no company with a market cap north of $500 billion has ever seen its stock price rise by more than 30% in a single trading day. Good news for Oracle on this front should also be good news for Nvidia, hence Nvidia's rising share price this week.
Larry Ellison, co-founder and chief technology officer of Oracle Corp. ORCL, has led a life full of remarkable and lesser-known accomplishments.

What Are Flush Door Handles And Their Risks? Flush door handles, simply put, are door handles that retract inside the door panel when not in use, providing a smooth design on the door, unlike traditional door handles that protrude. While the door handles do lend an aesthetically unique appearance to vehicles, they do pose some risks. China's Proposed BanAuthorities in China, meanwhile, are proposing a ban on flush door handles in the country, citing safety concerns with the design, as reported by local publication Mingjing Pro on September 4. The now-defunct company Fisker also used the flush design in its Ocean SUVs, which have now found a second life in NYC as fleet vehicles.
Tesla has faced plenty of adversity in 2025, but is it finally time to give up on its long-term ambitions? "Elon has reached peak Tesla (TSLA 7.21%) sales, and he knows it," said Karl Brauer, executive analyst at iSeeCars, according to Automotive News. So, is it finally time to give up on Tesla? Aside from the Cybercab, Tesla still has other developments to focus on in the near term. What it all meansWhile investors might have raised an eyebrow at that staggering announcement Tesla dropped on the market about a new compensation agreement for Elon Musk, potentially worth up to $1 trillion, the truth is that Tesla needs the best version of Elon Musk over the next decade.

If you'd invested $500 in this EV stock five years ago, here's how much you'd have today. Anyone who follows the business knows that the market buys what founder and CEO Elon Musk is selling. Tesla: Back to realityIntroducing a global robotaxi fleet or selling lots of humanoid robots to customers is far from a certainty, though. But Tesla shares, which trade at a nosebleed price-to-earnings ratio of 201, reflect flawless execution in the years ahead. In August, Tesla's market share of new EV sales in the U.S. was the lowest since 2017.
What's Driving The Tesla Stock SurgeAccording to Black, Tesla’s recent stock surge is not due to advancements in robotaxi technology but rather the anticipation of exceeding Wall Street’s delivery forecast. These developments could significantly influence Tesla’s earnings estimates and stock trajectory, despite an anticipated reversal in delivery volumes in the fourth quarter, according to Black. Tesla Under ScrutinyTesla’s performance in China has been under scrutiny, with sales falling 10% in August, marking the sixth decline in 2025. Losing Ground In USHowever, Tesla is losing ground in the U.S. market as new vehicle prices rise and EV sales hit new records. These mixed signals highlight the challenges Tesla faces in maintaining its market position amid global sales fluctuations and evolving market dynamics.
Whenever I discuss ride-sharing platform Lyft (LYFT 1.64%), I'm quickly met by a horde of people telling me that its days are numbered. And in 2026, I predict that Lyft stock will crush the market again. The value proposition for investorsMismatched expectations can lead to outstanding valuations, and that's certainly the case for Lyft stock. For investors, I don't think it matters what Lyft stock deserves, because it can win either way. Right now, it appears as though the investing community is finally waking up to how undervalued Lyft stock is.

However, the move's significance extends beyond Ford and speaks directly to investors in EV stocks such as Tesla (TSLA 7.21%). Why Ford's decision confirms the case for TeslaFord's news confirms a large part of the investment thesis for Tesla. Ford doesn't have the dominant market position of Tesla; Ford currently sells almost seven times fewer EVs in the U.S. than Tesla. On the other hand, Tesla's more than 46% share of the U.S. EV market gives it the scale and brand recognition to produce affordable cars and sell in volume. While Ford's decision is the right one, there's no guarantee it will work, and Ford's track record (Ford's Model e segment lost $5 billion last year) isn't great.
Real estate mogul and entrepreneur Grant Cardone is doubling down on a message he’s been pushing for years: college isn't worth it for most people. From Debt To AI: Why College No Longer Delivers“College degrees are not worth the cost,” Cardone said plainly. “41% of grads work at job that do not require a college degree,” he added. "To get rich in America, I do not need a college degree," Cardone told “VladTV” last year. Tesla TSLA CEO Elon Musk once said college isn't about learning, and entrepreneur and author Gary Vaynerchuk argues that anyone can learn business for free online.
That could change in 2026 due to one exciting EV stock. But when it came to pure electric vehicle sales, Tesla remained on top. Notably, General Motors came in third place with just under 900,000 battery-powered EVs sold last year -- roughly half of what Tesla and BYD sold. This left Tesla and BYD as the heavyweights in the global EV market, with Tesla just barely on top. BYD stock is priced at a discount, but investors must do their due diligence before jumping in.
On Friday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick criticized Tesla Inc. TSLA CEO Elon Musk's leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE, saying the billionaire prioritized firing workers over slashing waste, fraud and abuse, undermining the initiative's original mission. Lutnick: Musk Took The Wrong Lesson From TwitterSpeaking on the premiere of The Axios Show, Lutnick said Musk applied his Twitter-style playbook to the federal government, cutting jobs aggressively but achieving little in terms of meaningful savings. "The focus should have been on cutting the waste, fraud and abuse and the people you could do over time… I thought he got that backward." At the time, Musk insisted DOGE would "only grow stronger" and described it as "a way of life." "DOGE is still pursuing that waste, fraud and abuse I think it’ll be effective," Lutnick said.
Tesla shares were up 7.36% during Friday's regular session and down 0.0.99%, according to Benzinga Pro. Lawsuit Filed In San FranciscoThe lawsuit, filed Friday in San Francisco federal court, claims Tesla systematically discriminates against American workers in violation of civil rights law, reported Reuters. According to the complaint, Tesla hired an estimated 1,355 H-1B visa holders in 2024 while laying off more than 6,000 domestic employees, "the vast majority" believed to be U.S. citizens. The complaint argues that Tesla prefers H-1B visa workers because they can be paid less than U.S. employees for equivalent work — a practice the plaintiffs call "wage theft." Lawyers for the plaintiffs said the case could affect thousands of U.S. workers who either applied for Tesla jobs and were not hired or were laid off while visa holders remained.
Tesla Inc. TSLA Board Chair Robyn Denholm defended CEO Elon Musk‘s $1 trillion compensation package, arguing it motivates unique performance despite declining sales and profits. Check out the current price of TSLA stock here. She added that the package gives Musk shares worth nearly $1 trillion if he deploys one million autonomous taxis, one million robots, and increases Tesla's market value to $8.5 trillion. "It's actually about the voting influence in the company for the next generation of growth that he sees," she said. "I think it's a little bit weird talking about the dollars when it's actually the voting influence."
These metrics show just how much growth potential the electric vehicle company has. But if you think Rivian stock has gotten too expensive while its top line has been growing, think again. It's actually one of the cheapest electric vehicle stocks on the market today -- and these four charts show why. The electric vehicle industry has been on its growth journey for more than a decade. The looming launch of the R2 is why analysts expect more than 30% revenue growth from Rivian next year.

A surprising shift is rippling through Wall Street: EVs are back and the market has just switched gears on Tesla, Inc. TSLA. Dan Nathan, a trader on CNBC's "Fast Money," turned bullish on Tesla stock Thursday. The CatalystThere's a catalyst ahead that could propel Tesla even higher: the third-quarter deliveries report due Oct.2.

A Tesla Inc. TSLA engineer has slammed CEO Elon Musk's leadership at the EV giant, alleging that Musk has lied to the public and manipulated public discourse, among other things. Acknowledging his time at Tesla, Balestrieri thanked his colleagues and talked at length about his experiences before sharing why he left the company. Musk's package has been criticized by prominent figures, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt), who said that the compensation award was "grossly immoral" and reiterated worker rights. The billionaire's reported snub could raise questions about his relationship with the Trump camp following a series of anti-EV decisions taken by the government. Musk had donated more than $250 million to Trump in the run-up to last year's presidential election.
Electric vehicle sales worldwide grew 15% in August, with 1.16 million Battery Electric Vehicles and over 570,000 Plug-In Hybrid EVs sold across the globe. 12.7 Million Units Sold In 2025Global EV sales from January to August reached 12.7 million units, according to global sales data shared by market research firm Rho Motion on Thursday.

The board of Tesla (TSLA 7.21%) recently answered this question when it revealed its proposed compensation package for CEO Elon Musk, which could be worth more than $1 trillion. That's largely because of Musk's high-tech vision for the company, which includes developing fully self-driving robotaxis and autonomous humanoid robots. That's a powerful incentive for Tesla's board to keep Musk at the helm. Well, although the "trillion-dollar" aspect of the pay package has been highlighted, it's not like Tesla's board is just planning to hand Musk $1 trillion in cash. Others require him to successfully develop new products, including full self-driving EVs, robotaxis, and autonomous humanoid robots.
The saturation of the early adopter market, rising interest rates, the reduction of government subsidies, and the slower buildout of EV charging networks all chilled the market and drove many investors away from EV stocks. Three of those underappreciated EV stocks that are still well below their all-time highs are BYD (BYDDY -1.91%), QuantumScape (QS 12.43%), and EVgo (EVGO 4.32%). It also claims its own lithium iron phosphate "Blade" batteries are cheaper, safer, and more power-efficient than traditional lithium ion batteries. That scale enabled BYD to cut its prices to fend off its competitors and grow its dominant share of China's fragmented EV market. EVgo's valuations are likely being squeezed by the softness of the U.S. EV market and competition from other EV charging station builders like ChargePoint and Tesla.
