Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi noted that most industries are now cutting jobs — a trend typically seen only in recessions.

Tesla, Microsoft, and Apple are the three Retail stocks to watch today, according to MarketBeat’s stock screener tool. Retail stocks are shares of publicly traded companies whose core business involves selling goods and services directly to end consumers, whether through brick-and-mortar outlets, e-commerce platforms, or a hybrid of both. Investors often track retail stocks to gauge consumer spending patterns and broader economic health. These companies had the highest dollar trading volume of any Retail stocks within the last several days. The Productivity and Business Processes segment offers office, exchange, SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, office 365 Security and Compliance, Microsoft viva, and Microsoft 365 copilot; and office consumer services, such as Microsoft 365 consumer subscriptions, Office licensed on-premises, and other office services.
The verdict comes after a group of users brought the case claiming Google accessed users’ mobile devices to collect, save and use their data, in violation of privacy assurances in its Web & App Activity setting. Plaintiffs allege that regardless of whether Class Members had these settings paused or turned off, Google collected app activity data using certain code embedded within many non-Google apps. Technically, it doesn’t really make sense that flipping a switch on an Android phone would turn off Google Analytics across the Web and third-party apps. Google employees accordingly describe WAA as a “terrible control” (GOOG-RDGZ-00130416) and a “loser” (GOOG-RDGZ-00144760), and lament how “Web & App Activity is the worst name ever” (GOOG-RDGZ-00089546). In comparison, the Apple lawsuits are about how turning off a system-wide “share analytics” switch did not prevent system apps from sending personally identifiable data to Apple.
